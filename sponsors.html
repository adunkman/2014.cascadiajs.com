                    <p>At CascadiaJS 2014, over 300 JavaScript programmers will be gathering in
                    Portland, OR for a single-track, two-day, developer-run conference focused on
                    the cutting-edge of JavaScript technology. Browser, server, OS, we cover it
                    all. We started this adventure back in 2012, where developers from all over the
                    Pacific Northwest (and beyond!) gathered to talk JS and open web technologies.
                    We want to focus the sponsorships on creating amazing shared experiences, which
                    have a far broader and longer lasting effect for you and the attendees.</p>

                    <p>CascadiaJS 2014 will be held in Portland, OR on July 31-August 1. There will be
                    <strong>over 300 attendees</strong>, drawing primarily from Portland, Seattle and Vancouver. We
                    fully expect this year to exceed last year’s quality of speakers and attendees.
                    With our continued dedication to quality we are anticipating the quickest
                    sellout yet, once tickets go on sale.</p>
                    <p>Sponsorships are <em>limited</em>. Since this is an all-volunteer and not-for-profit
                    event, the only purpose of the sponsorship funds is to fund T&amp;E for the
                    speakers and to provide an amazing educational and fun experience for the
                    attendees. As soon as these needs are covered, we will not accept any more
                    sponsorship proposals.</p>
                    <p>Please Note: Sponsors are strongly encouraged to help increase the diversity at
                    CascadiaJS, please consider this when assigning tickets. We appreciate your
                    support in helping to bring diversity to the community and to community events.</p>
